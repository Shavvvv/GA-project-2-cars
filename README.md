# GA-Project2 

# Cars-RevLine

Hello all and welcome to my [project](https://courageous-pantsuit-tick.cyclic.app/ "GA-project-2")
. This is a social photo sharing web application made utilizing my knowlege of full stack development. Its purpose is allow users to upload their images and share it, allowing others to comment as well.With this being a user centric CRUD application, they will be allowed to edit  posts they've made, as well as delete comments. I look ofrward to seeing all your pictures and hearing about your experience!

## Guide

1. You will be presented with the initial page requesting you to log in to continue.
2. Once logged in, you will have full access,with the ability to  to view the posts made by other users and comment on a post. 
3. You also have the ability to link your own images with a caption, that others can comment on.
* If you are copying an image from a website, make sure to _Copy image address_
* If its an upload from your pc, Its best to upload first to [imgur](https://imgur.com/"imgur") , then copy the DIRECT LINK 
4. If your image didnt render on the screen you have the ability to edit the post2.




## Key Technologies Used
 [Node.JS] (https://nodejs.org/en/about "Node.js")
 [Express.js] (https://expressjs.com/"Express")
 [Mongoose] (https://mongoosejs.com/docs/index.html"Mongoose")
 [mongoDB] (https://www.mongodb.com/atlas"mongoDB Atlas")


## Moving Forward...

I plan on rendering the web app more functionality such as:
* Allowing the user to perform CRUD operations on their personal information, an throughout other aspects of the application.
* A category option, where it will filter out different posts based on their key terms like "memes" or "performance"
